    "\n",
    "This package allows the user to synthesize physiologically accurage movement by combining biomechanical expertise with SoA control strategies using Deep Reinforcement Learning. \n",
    "This library's goals are to:\n",
    "- use Reinforcement Learning (RL) to solve problems in healthcare.\n",
    "- promote open-source tools in RL research (the physics simulator, the RL environment, and the competition platform on which we run challenges are all open-source).\n",
    "- encourage RL research in computationally complex environments, with stochasticity and highly-dimensional action spaces, relevant to real-life applications.\n",
    "- bridge biomechanics, neuroscience, and computer science communities.\n",
